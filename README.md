# HB Music Studio

# About the Project
This website serves as the online 'storefront' for the services HB Music Studio provides: voice lessons, choral compositions. It's also the future home of HB Music Studio's podcast, "Teachers Who Quit," which is an interview-based podcast about teachers who decided to leave teaching in the American public school system. Prospective voice students will be able to learn about HB's teaching philosophy, policies and rates, and inquire about openings in the studio. Established students (and their guardians) will be able to use this as a hub for information regarding studio schedules, COVID-19 policies, and upcoming recitals. Choral conductors will be able to peruse the catalog of compositions, listen to recordings, and request more information about commissioning a new piece.

Challenges I Navigated 
- Familiarizing myself with an existing codebase, because I started with a template from HTML5up. I had to decide what content was relevant to this project, and what could be deleted or commented out, especially in the HTML and CSS.
  
- This project has strengthened my Flexbox skills immensely. Positioning the cards on the Compositions page was the trickiest, because I wanted an even number of cards per row, and also wanted it to be responsive. This project also forced me to ask myself constantly, "Do I really need another div here?", and oftentimes I used semantic HTML instead.
